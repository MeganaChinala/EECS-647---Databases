adapted project from Dr. Bo Luo - EECS 647: Introduction to Databases

This project's purpose is to create a database system for a
"bar crawl" type setting. Users will be able to create an account
that stores their driver's license as well as bars they visit - plus
allowing queries to review the most popular bars in the area. Additionally,
their account gives them access to remedies to alleviate hangovers.

We will be using React, Node.js, and SQL

Our project will be broken up into 4 separate parts.

==========================================================
Part 1 is overall idea design and creating ER diagrams +
logical designs for the idea we have.
